This document contains the rationale behind the
schema design.

Table User
There will only be one admin and the system will
check the username to see if it is the admin; this is obviously a security flaw but this is not a real world implementation.

Table Quiz
A quiz is randomly generated when a user requests
to take a quiz. Due to this, every quiz is unique
and assigned a user. The quiz object will contain
5 easy questions, 3 medium questions, and 2 hard
questions.

Table Question
Quizes may have multiple questions. A question will 
contain a difficulty of 1 to 3, 1 being easy and 3 
being hard. The "type" of question will specify to 
the client how to display the question and its
assiocated answers.

We can hardcode type selections during quiz creation
to make sure there are no discrepancies. 

Table Answer
Questions may have multiple answers and some may or
may not be correct.

NOTE
Because question types are not specified, nor is the reviewing of a previously attempted quiz a requirement, there is no need to save user input aside from their final score.

All questions will have a score value of 1 (therefore each quiz has a max score of 10).

Implementable question types based on this schema are:

Multi choice
Multi multi choice

If other question types are used (short answer, matching, numerical input/steps), the schema has to change.
